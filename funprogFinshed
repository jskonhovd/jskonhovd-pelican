I just sumbitted my final programming assignment for the Functional Programming Principles in Scala class!!!! 
Now, I was pretty lazy with the final assignment. No pun intend, The last assignment covered streams and lazy evaluation. :) 
But, I am exicted that I have offically completed my first MOOCs. This MOOC has been difficult. If you have never taking a

But I am happy I completed this course, I feel like I am on the right track to become functionally literate.
