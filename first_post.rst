Introduction
------------

Hi! I am moving my blogging over to pelican and github. This should be my first post.

My old blog was cool, and it can be found at d0sduck_. I have over a hundred posts over there and you should check it out. I am leaving blogger because there is just something legit about blogging while never leaving the command line.
