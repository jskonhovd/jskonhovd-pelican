I just submitted my final programming assignment for the Functional Programming Principles in Scala class!!!! Now, I was pretty lazy with the final assignment. The last assignment covered streams and lazy evaluation. :) But, I am excited that I have officially completed my first MOOCs. This MOOC has been difficult, but I really enjoied the subject matter.I am taking a break from MOOCs for a while. Well, It depends on what courses are open in the fall. 

I am super excited that Georgia Tech has announced a partnership with Udacity. They will be offering a completely online masters of Computer Science. The best part about this completely online masters is that it will cost less than 7000$. 

So, I will now explain my current course of action. I am currently going to focus my free time on working on Projects and studying algorithms. I have a new algorithm book, The Algorithm Design Manual. I am going to shelve the other books I was reading for a later date. So far, The Algorithm Design Manual seems a little more applied than CLRS, and the war stories are not as dry as a typical algorithm book.

The projects I will be working on are just to get more practical examples into my GitHub. I think I will perform better on interviews if I had something more practical to speak to and show. I will give more details on those projects in a later blog. Anyway, have a great day and thanks for reading.
