I just sumbitted my final programming assignment for the Functional Programming Principles in Scala class!!!! 
Now, I was pretty lazy with the final assignment. No pun intend, The last assignment covered streams and lazy evaluation. :) 
But, I am exicted that I have offically completed my first MOOCs. This MOOC has been difficult. If you have never taking a
serious course and worked a 40+ hour week, you should know that my weekends have been completly taken over by the course.
But I am happy I completed this course, I feel like I am on the right track to become functionally literate. 


I am taking a break from MOOCs for a while. It depends on what comes back up in the fall. I am going back to studying my backlog 
in books. I believe I learn more from MOOCs in a short amount of time, but I feel like I have been neglecting other areas in my life. 
I am also kinda worne out. So a little break will be all right for now. I will be taking more MOOCs in the future, especailly since 
since Udacity and Georgia Tech are doing a online Master's degree for less than 7000 dollars.
