I just submitted my final programming assignment for the Functional Programming Principles in Scala class!!!! Now, I was pretty lazy with the final assignment. No pun intend, The last assignment covered streams and lazy evaluation. :) But, I am excited that I have officially completed my first MOOCs. This MOOC has been difficult. If you have never taken a serious course and worked a 40+ hour week, you should know that my weekends have been completely taken over by the course. But I am happy I completed this course, I feel like I am on the right track to become functionally literate.

I am taking a break from MOOCs for a while. It depends on what courses are open in the fall. MOOCs are great. I have taken two since the start of this year. But, I am also kinda worn out. So a little break will be all right for now. I will be taking more MOOCs in the future.

I am super excited that Georgia Tech has announced a partnership with Udacity. They will be offering a completely online masters of Computer Science. The best part about this completely online masters is that it will cost less than 7000$. This is a game changer for me. I graduated from the University of Memphis with a modest GPA of 3.31. I know I would not be on a short list for any fellowships. But with this program, It wouldn't matter. The program will cost less than a reasonable used car. I can afford that. Also, Since this program is completely online, I can live in Nashville or Memphis. I don't have to change my wife's life so I can get a affordable education. I am only worried about getting admitted. I think I am well above Gtech's current minimum requirements, but who knows if they can scale immediately to a MOOCs level of enrollment. I think there are a lot of talented engineers in the same boat as me.

So, I will now explain my current course of action. I am currently going to focus my free time on working on Projects and studying algorithms. I have a new algorithm book, The Algorithm Design Manual. I am going to shelve the other books I was reading for a later date. So far, The Algorithm Design Manual seems a little more applied than CLRS, and the war stories are not as dry as a typical algorithm book. I have been looking over the algorithm course on Coursera. I had the need to review certain items. 

The projects I will be working on are just to get some practical applications of interesting frameworks into my GitHub. I just need some more practical code in my GitHub, other than algorithm problems. I think I will perform better on interviews if I had something more practical to speak to and show. I will give more details on those projects in a later blog. Anyway, have a great day and thanks for reading.
